# üïê Timeout Mechanisms and Logging Improvements

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive timeout mechanisms and logging improvements added to the MeTruyenCV downloader to prevent hanging and provide better debugging capabilities.

## üÜï New Features Added

### 1. **Enhanced Logging System** (`logger.py`)
- **Timestamped logs** with colored console output and emojis
- **Context-aware logging** with chapter numbers and operation types
- **Progress tracking** for chapter downloads and image processing
- **File logging** support for detailed debugging
- **Thread-safe** logging for async operations
- **Multiple log levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

### 2. **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff** (`retry_utils.py`)
- **Configurable retry attempts** for different operation types
- **Exponential backoff** with jitter to avoid thundering herd
- **Smart exception handling** - only retry appropriate exceptions
- **Operation-specific configurations**:
  - Page loading: 3 attempts, 2-10s delays
  - Element finding: 2 attempts, 1-5s delays
  - Image downloads: 3 attempts, 1-15s delays
  - Network requests: 3 attempts, 1-10s delays

### 3. **Comprehensive Timeout Configuration** (`config_manager.py`)
New `[TIMEOUTS]` section in `config.txt`:
```ini
[TIMEOUTS]
page_load_timeout = 30          # Page loading timeout (seconds)
element_wait_timeout = 10       # Element finding timeout (seconds)
image_download_timeout = 60     # Image download timeout (seconds)
overall_chapter_timeout = 300   # Overall chapter processing timeout (5 minutes)
retry_delay_base = 1            # Base delay for exponential backoff (seconds)
max_retry_delay = 30            # Maximum retry delay (seconds)
```

### 4. **Enhanced Application Settings**
New `[ADVANCED]` options:
```ini
[ADVANCED]
enable_detailed_logging = true  # Enable detailed logging
log_file = download.log         # Log file path (optional)
```

## üîß Key Improvements in `main_config.py`

### **1. Driver Initialization**
- **Configurable timeouts** from settings instead of hardcoded values
- **Enhanced error logging** with context information
- **Retry mechanism** for driver creation

### **2. Chapter Processing (`get_chapter_with_selenium_browser`)**
- **Overall chapter timeout** (300s default) to prevent infinite loops
- **Configurable element wait timeouts** (10s default)
- **Progress tracking** with start/complete logging
- **Detailed operation logging** for debugging
- **Graceful error handling** with proper cleanup

### **3. Network Operations**
- **HTTP client timeout configuration**:
  - Connect timeout: 10s
  - Read timeout: 60s (configurable)
  - Write timeout: 10s
  - Pool timeout: 5s
- **Retry mechanism** for image downloads and API calls

### **4. Progress Tracking**
- **Chapter-level progress** with success/failure tracking
- **Image download progress** indicators
- **Performance metrics** (download duration, success rates)
- **Summary statistics** at completion

## üìä Timeout Protection Layers

### **Layer 1: Operation-Level Timeouts**
- Page loading: 30s (configurable)
- Element finding: 10s (configurable)
- Image downloads: 60s (configurable)

### **Layer 2: Chapter-Level Timeout**
- Overall chapter processing: 300s (5 minutes, configurable)
- Prevents infinite loops in chapter processing

### **Layer 3: Retry with Backoff**
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming servers
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite retries

### **Layer 4: Graceful Degradation**
- Continue processing remaining chapters if one fails
- Fallback from Selenium to httpx for content retrieval
- Proper resource cleanup even on failures

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### **Adjusting Timeouts for Slow Networks**
Edit `config.txt`:
```ini
[TIMEOUTS]
page_load_timeout = 60          # Increase for slow connections
element_wait_timeout = 20       # More time for element loading
image_download_timeout = 120    # Longer image download timeout
overall_chapter_timeout = 600   # 10 minutes per chapter
```

### **Enabling Detailed Logging**
```ini
[ADVANCED]
enable_detailed_logging = true
log_file = debug.log
```

### **Adjusting Retry Behavior**
```ini
[SETTINGS]
retry_attempts = 5              # More retry attempts

[TIMEOUTS]
retry_delay_base = 2            # Longer base delay
max_retry_delay = 60            # Higher maximum delay
```

## üîç Debugging Features

### **Log Messages Include:**
- **Timestamps** for timing analysis
- **Context information** (chapter numbers, operation types)
- **Progress indicators** (current/total chapters)
- **Performance metrics** (duration, success rates)
- **Error details** with truncated messages for readability

### **Timeout Events Logged:**
- Page load timeouts
- Element finding timeouts
- Image download timeouts
- Overall chapter processing timeouts
- Retry attempts with delays

### **Progress Tracking:**
- Chapter download start/completion
- Image download progress
- Overall download statistics
- Success/failure rates

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Improvements

### **Graceful Timeout Handling:**
- Log timeout events with context
- Continue processing other chapters
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Clean up resources properly

### **Smart Retry Logic:**
- Only retry appropriate exceptions (network, timeout)
- Don't retry permanent failures (404, parsing errors)
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Maximum retry limits

### **Resource Management:**
- Proper WebDriver cleanup
- Memory management with garbage collection
- Connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Async operation cancellation support

## üìà Performance Benefits

1. **Prevents Hanging**: Multiple timeout layers prevent infinite waits
2. **Better Resource Usage**: Proper cleanup and connection pooling
3. **Faster Failure Recovery**: Quick retry with exponential backoff
4. **Improved Debugging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
5. **User Feedback**: Progress indicators and status updates

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All improvements maintain full backward compatibility:
- Existing `config.txt` files work without modification
- Default timeout values are conservative and safe
- New features are opt-in through configuration
- Existing command-line behavior unchanged

## üéØ Next Steps

The timeout and logging system is now comprehensive and production-ready. Users can:

1. **Run with defaults** - Works out of the box with safe timeouts
2. **Customize timeouts** - Adjust based on network conditions
3. **Enable detailed logging** - For debugging and monitoring
4. **Monitor progress** - Real-time feedback on download status

The system now provides robust protection against hanging while maintaining the fully automated mode that users prefer.
